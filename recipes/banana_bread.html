        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>

        <li>Pour batter into the prepared loaf pan and spread into an even layer.</li>
        <li>Slice remaining banana in half lengthwise; lay banana halves over the top, cut side up. Evenly sprinkle remaining 1 tablespoon brown sugar over the top.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a wooden pick inserted in the center comes out with a few moist crumbs, 50 to 55 minutes. Let cool in pan on a wire rack for 15 minutes; using parchment paper overhang.</li>
